{"name":"activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter","body":"The Spatialite ActiveRecord Adapter extends the standard MySQL adapter to provide support for the MySQL spatial extensions, using the [RGeo](http://dazuma.github.com/rgeo) library to represent spatial data in Ruby. It provides:\r\n\r\n* Extensions to the migration syntax for creating spatial columns and indexes\r\n* Attributes using RGeo spatial data types\r\n* Spatial queries\r\n* Spatialite versions of some of the ActiveRecord rake tasks\r\n\r\n**IMPORTANT NOTE:** This is a legacy adapter, and is not supported for versions of Rails beyond 3.1. This is because of bugs in the mysql gem. We recommend using the mysql2 gem instead, along with the [activerecord-mysql2spatial-adapter](http://dazuma.github.com/activerecord-mysql2spatial-adapter)\r\n\r\nFor more information:\r\n\r\n* See the [documentation](http://dazuma.github.com/activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter/rdoc)\r\n* Source code on [Github](http://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter)\r\n* Report issues [here](http://github.com/dazuma/activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter/issues)\r\n* Questions?
