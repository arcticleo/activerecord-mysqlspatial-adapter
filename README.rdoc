== MySQL Spatial ActiveRecord Adapter

This is an ActiveRecord connection adapter for MySQL Spatial Extensions.
It is based on the stock MySQL adapter, but provides built-in support for
spatial columns. It uses the RGeo library to represent spatial data.

=== Summary

The MySQL Spatial ActiveRecord Adapter is an ActiveRecord connection
adapter based on the standard mysql adapter. It extends the stock adapter
to provide support for spatial columns in MySQL, mapping the values
properly to RGeo spatial objects. Like the standard mysql adapter, this
requires the mysql gem (version 2.8 or later).

To use this adapter, add this gem, "activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter",
to your Gemfile, and then request the adapter name "mysqlspatial" in
your database connection configuration (which, for a Rails application,
is in the config/database.yml file). The other database connection
configuration parameters are the same as for the stock mysql adapter.

=== Installation

This adapter has the following requirements:

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later. Ruby 1.9.2 or later preferred.
* ActiveRecord 3.0.3 or later.
* rgeo-activerecord gem 0.2.0 or later.
* mysql gem 2.8.1 or later.
* MySQL server 5.0 or later required for spatial extensions.

Install this adapter as a gem:

 gem install activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter

See the README for the required "rgeo" gem for further installation
information.

RGeo is written by Daniel Azuma (http://www.daniel-azuma.com).

Development of RGeo is sponsored by GeoPage, Inc. (http://www.geopage.com).

This adapter implementation owes some debt to the spatial_adapter plugin
(http://github.com/fragility/spatial_adapter). While we made a few
different design decisions for this adapter, studying the spatial_adapter
source gave us a head start on the implementation.
