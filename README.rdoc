== MySQL Spatial ActiveRecord Adapter

The MySQL Spatial ActiveRecord Adapter is an ActiveRecord connection
adapter based on the standard mysql adapter. It extends the stock adapter
to provide support for spatial columns and indexes in MySQL, using the
RGeo library to represent spatial data in Ruby. Like the standard mysql
adapter, this adapter requires the mysql gem.

=== Usage

To use this adapter, add this gem, "activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter",
to your Gemfile, and then request the adapter name "mysqlspatial" in
your database connection configuration (which, for a Rails application,
is in the config/database.yml file). The other database connection
configuration parameters are the same as for the stock mysql adapter.

First, this adapter extends the migration syntax to support creating 
spatial columns and indexes. To create a spatial column, use the
<tt>:geometry</tt> type, or any of the OGC spatial types such as
<tt>:point</tt> or <tt>:line_string</tt>. To create a spatial index, set
the <tt>:spatial</tt> option to true. Remember that, on some versions of
MySQL, only the MyISAM engine supports spatial indexes, and the indexed
column may need to be NOT NULL.

Examples:

 create_table :spatial_table, :options => 'ENGINE=MyISAM' do |t|
   t.column :latlon, :point, :null => false
   t.line_string :path
   t.geometry :shape
 end
 change_table :spatial_table do |t|
   t.index :latlon, :spatial => true
 end

When this adapter is in use, spatial attributes in your ActiveRecord
objects will have RGeo geometry values. You can set spatial attributes
either to RGeo geometry objects, or to strings in WKT (well-known text)
format, which the adapter will automatically convert to geometry objects.

To specify the RGeo geometry factory, you can either set an explicit
factory for a column, or provide a factory generator that will yield the
appropriate factory for the table's spatial columns based on the value.
For the former, call the set_rgeo_factory_for_column class method on your
ActiveRecord class. For the latter, set the rgeo_factory_generator class
attribute. This generator should understand at least the <tt>:srid</tt>
options, which will be provided based on the SRID embedded in the value
itself, since MySQL does not support SRID or dimension constraints on
spatial columns themselves. The set_rgeo_factory_for_column and
rgeo_factory_generator methods are actually implemented and documented in
the <b>rgeo-activerecord</b> gem.

Examples, given the spatial table defined above:

 class SpatialTable < ActiveRecord::Base
   
   # By default, use the GEOS implementation for spatial columns.
   self.rgeo_factory_generator = RGeo::Geos.method(:factory)
   
   # But use a geographic implementation for the :latlon column.
   set_rgeo_factory_for_column(:latlon, RGeo::Geographic.spherical_factory)
   
 end

Now you can interact with the data using the RGeo types:

 rec = SpatialTable.new
 rec.latlon = 'POINT(-122 47)'   # You can set by feature object or WKT.
 loc = rec.latlon                # Accessing always returns a feature object, in
                                 # this case, a geographic that understands latitude.
 loc.latitude                    # => 47
 rec.shape = loc                 # the factory for the :shape column is GEOS, so the
                                 # value will be cast from geographic to GEOS.
 RGeo::Geos.is_geos?(rec.shape)  # => true

=== Installation

This adapter has the following requirements:

* Ruby 1.8.7 or later. Ruby 1.9.2 or later preferred.
* MySQL server 5.0 or later required for spatial extensions.
* ActiveRecord 3.0.3 or later. Earlier versions will not work.
* rgeo-activerecord gem 0.2.0 or later.
* mysql gem 2.8 or later.

Install this adapter as a gem:

 gem install activerecord-mysqlspatial-adapter

See the README for the "rgeo" gem, a required dependency, for further
installation information.

This adapter implementation owes some debt to the spatial_adapter plugin
(http://github.com/fragility/spatial_adapter). While we made a few
different design decisions for this adapter, studying the spatial_adapter
source gave us a head start on the implementation.
